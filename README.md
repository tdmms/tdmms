## Two-dimensional materials manufacturing system (2DMMS)
Open-source software for automated searching and assembly for van der Waals heterostructures

*Note that this webpage is currently under development.*

### About 2DMMS
Open-source platform for aunotnomous robotic searching and assembl of van der Waals heterostructures. The following functionalities are supported:

* Automated searching for atomically thin exfoliated 2D crystals on SiO2/Si substrate
* Building the database of opitcal microscope images of detected 2D crystals
* Computer assisted design of van der Waals heterostructures by selecting the 2D crystals from the database
* Semi-automated assembly of designed van der Waals heterostructures

### License
* The software is licenced under BSD-3-Clause License

### Software Requirements
The following software components are required.
* Ubuntu 14.04 or higher
* ROS Indigo
* QT 5.2.1 or higher
* HALCON12 Image processing library
* Open CL
* MySQL

### Hardware support
